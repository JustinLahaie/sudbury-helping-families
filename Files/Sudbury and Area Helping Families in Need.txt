About Us: (can also be on main)

Sudbury and Area Helping Families in Need (Also known as Sudbury Helping Families) is a community-driven, grassroots charity founded in 2012 with a simple but powerful mission: to support local families and individuals who are struggling to meet basic needs.

Since our inception, we have assisted more than 200 families across the Sudbury area, providing meaningful support during times of financial hardship, housing insecurity, and crisis. Our work has included delivering food and essential items, purchasing and donating pizza to unsheltered individuals, sponsoring a hockey team to reduce costs and ensuring that children and families experience dignity, care, and community support when they need it most.

Beyond direct assistance, we believe in community connection and inclusion. We are proud to have reintroduced toddler, pre-teen, and teen dances in Valley East, creating safe, affordable, and welcoming spaces for young people to socialize, build confidence, and simply be kids.

Our impact is strengthened through collaboration. We have partnered with respected community organizations, including:

Northern Ontario Families of Children with Cancer

YWCA Geneva House

City of Sudbury Social Services

Manitoulin Sudbury District Social Services Board

and other local agencies and community partners


Sudbury and Area Helping Families in Need receives no government funding. Every dollar raised goes directly back into the community through donations, partnerships, and local initiatives. Our work is made possible entirely through the generosity of donors, volunteers, and supporters who believe that no one in our community should be left behind.

Together, we are making a difference—one family, one meal, and one act of kindness at a time.

Also maybe we can add a spot people can comment - approvals need to be done by myself but a spot saying something like: Have we made an impact to your family, please feel free to share!
